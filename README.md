**MindEase** is an AI-powered personal mental health coach designed to provide anonymous, stigma-free emotional support. It uses the **OpenAI API** to drive empathetic, natural conversations with indirect questioning that reduces answer bias, building a safe space for users to open up. Through **Hugging Face’s Inference API**, it applies specialized depression, anxiety, and emotion classification models to cross-check conversational insights and improve prediction accuracy. An optional **Google Cloud Speech-to-Text** integration enables voice interaction, expanding accessibility for users who prefer speaking over typing.

The AI not only analyzes *what* users say but also *how* they say it — tracking behavioral cues like response delays, typing pauses, and shifts in tone across sessions. Based on these insights, it calculates a probability score for possible mental health conditions, always with ethical disclaimers that it is not a substitute for professional diagnosis. It then offers personalized coping strategies such as breathing exercises, lifestyle adjustments, journaling prompts, and gentle encouragement to seek professional help.

Data privacy is central: all usage can remain completely anonymous, with local data storage unless cloud sync is enabled. The platform can run as a **web app or mobile app**, includes a mood trend dashboard via Chart.js, and can optionally allow mental health professionals to provide training feedback, improving the AI’s performance over time without overfitting. The ultimate aim is to break mental health stigma, detect early warning signs, and connect people with the help they need — without judgment, pressure, or exposure.
